Encryption is widely recognized as one of the best ways to keep all of your digital information private. The idea of keeping written communications private has been around for nearly as long as writing itself. Modern encryption methods are nearly impossible to crack, even using extremely powerful supercomputers. These services use encryption to protect your files, your internet activity, and your communication. It's hard to justify <em>not using</em> encryption tools when there are so many options available regardless of your technical abilities or personal needs.

<h2><strong>Full Disk Encryption</strong></h2>
Full Disk Encryption is when all the contents of a hard drive including the encryption program itself are encrypted. This level of encryption converts all device data in a form that can only be read by a user with the encryption key. This key is what the encryption system uses to reverse the encrypted data into a decrypted format.
<h3><strong>1. BitLocker</strong></h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLocker"><strong>BitLocker</strong></a> is a full disk encryption feature included with Microsoft Windows. It was originally added to Windows' operating system in 2004. It has three encryption modes: <strong>transparent operation mode, user authentication mode</strong>, and <strong>USB key mode</strong>. This gives users control over how they verify their identity and access their files.
<h3><strong>2. FileVault 2</strong></h3>
<strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837">FileVault 2</a></strong> is Apple's encryption program that encrypts data on Macs to prevent any unwanted access to files and other information. All macOS users have access to FileVault and will just need to enable it to encrypt their hard drives. FileVault2 supports older Mac hardware, and can be centrally managed if you're using it across all devices on a business network. It's easy to set up because it is included in macOS.
<h3><strong>3. LUKS</strong></h3>
<a href="https://guardianproject.info/code/luks/"><strong>LUKS</strong></a> (Linux Unified Key Setup) is a disk encryption service for Linux. Unlike other Linux disk encryption solutions, LUKS stores all setup information in the partition header, which enables the user to transport or migrate any data seamlessly.
<h3><strong>4. VeraCrypt</strong></h3>
<strong><a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">VeraCrypt </a></strong>is a disk encryption software for Windows, MacOS and Linux. It works by making a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk. This way you can store your files on your physical hard drive, but they are protected in this virtual disk. You can also use VeraCrypt to encrypt external storage devices like flash drives or external hard dives.
<h3><strong>5. CipherShed</strong></h3>
<strong><a href="https://www.ciphershed.org/">CipherShed</a> </strong>is a free encryption software for keeping your data secure and private. It started as a fork of the now-discontinued TrueCrypt Project. CipherShed is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It's open source so you can <a href="https://github.com/CipherShed/CipherShed">view the code here</a>.

<h2><strong>File Encryption Software</strong></h2>
File encryption software is a type of program users install on their devices to encrypt specific files on his or her computer. It's used much like full disk encryption except it only applies to certain files that the user chooses. If someone doesn't want to install full disk encryption because of user-experience issues, they can use file encryption software to only encrypt the sensitive files on their devices. Then when they need to access these files they may have to enter a password or use another authentication measure to view them.
<h3><strong>1. Encrypto</strong></h3>
<strong><a href="https://macpaw.com/encrypto">Encrypto</a> </strong>lets you encrypt files before sending them to friends or coworkers. Drop a file into Encrypto, set a password, and then send it with added security. This is an especially useful tool if you want information to remain confidential but still want to use email or other messaging programs to send it. You can create an embedded password hint that only the intended recipient would be able to decipher or understand. When you send a file that's encrypted with Encrypto, you can use almost any method to send it, including AirDrop, email, iMessage or Dropbox.
<h3><strong>2. Cryptomator</strong></h3>
<strong><a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator</a> </strong>is a free, client-side encryption software for your cloud files. It’s totally open source and relies only on donations for its revenue. When installed on your device, Cryptomator uses transparent encryption which means you won’t notice a difference when working with your encrypted files. It makes it easy to access and work with your files even in their encrypted form. Cryptomator lets you create vaults anywhere, even within your existing Dropbox or Google Drive.
<h3><strong>3. Boxcryptor</strong></h3>
<strong><a href="https://www.boxcryptor.com/en/">BoxCryptor</a></strong> is a free encryption program available for multiple platforms that creates an encrypted folder that can be placed inside your cloud storage folder. It's easy to use as all you have to do to encrypt a file is place it inside the "Boxcryptor" folder. To then access those files you just have to open BoxCryptor, navigate to the encrypted folder and enter your password.
<h3><strong>4. AES Crypt</strong></h3>
<strong><a href="https://www.aescrypt.com/">AES Crypt</a></strong> is a file encryption software available on several operating systems that uses the industry standard Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to easily and securely encrypt files.

You do not need to be an expert to use AES Crypt, nor do you need to understand cryptography. When using Windows, the only thing you need to do is right-click on a file, select AES Encrypt or AES Decrypt, enter a password, and AES Crypt will do the rest. On a Mac, you can drag a file to the AES Crypt program and provide the required password. AES Crypt also offers command line support for more technically adept users.
<h3><strong>5. EncFS</strong></h3>
<a href="https://github.com/vgough/encfs"><strong>EncFS</strong></a> is a free cyptographic filesystem. It transparently encrypts files, which means that an authenticated end user cannot tell that the data was encrypted before he or she opens it. EncFS encrypts files using a volume key, which is stored either within or outside the encrypted source directory. Users need a password to decrypt this key.
<h3><strong>6. AxCrypt</strong></h3>
<a href="https://www.axcrypt.net/"><strong>AxCrypt</strong></a> is an open-source file encryption software for Windows, Mac and mobile. It's available in both free and paid versions. It lets users compress, delete, encrypt and decrypt, and edit files. AxCrypt is a file-based encryption program as opposed to a container-based program. This means each individual file is encrypted rather than storing files in an encrypted container or folder. You can also use Axcrypt to protect files in your DropBox or Google Drive account using AES-128 and AES-256 encryption standards. To access the encrypted contents of a file or folder Axcrypt uses either a password or a key file. You can use AxCrypt to delete files and it will scramble the data before deleting them. This helps prevent any unwanted access to your files after they've been deleted.

<h2><strong>Encrypted Internet Traffic</strong></h2>
If you're concerned with keeping your internet browsing private, the best way to keep it that way is encryption. This essentially scrambles information like the websites you visit and your <a href="http://choosetoencrypt.com/tech/what-is-my-ip-address/">IP address</a> so that websites you visit can't easily identify you. A secure browser using privacy extensions, connected to the web via VPN will help keep your identity hidden and other tracking information private.
<h3><strong>1. Tor Browser</strong></h3>
Tor (The Onion Router) is one of the most trusted and established names in advanced internet security and privacy. Tor Browser uses Tor’s distributed network of volunteer-run relays to bounce your communications all over. This prevents anyone from monitoring your internet connection and learning which sites you visit and where you’re located. Tor Browser is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Tor is essentially a beefed-up version of Firefox that is set up to run on Tor’s anonymous network. Tor can protect you from ‘browser fingerprinting’, which is when a tracker identifies you based on the characteristics of your browser.
<h3><strong>2. ExpressVPN</strong></h3>
